CyTOF_Data Analysis
============
Repository of the [Cell Communication Lab](http://tape-lab.com/) at UCL's Cancer Institute. The Cell Communication Lab studies how oncogenic mutations communicate with stromal and immune cells in the colorectal cancer (CRC) tumour microenvironment (TME). By understanding how mutations regulate all cell types within a tumour, we aim to uncover novel approaches to treat cancer. 

In this repo we present a workflow for analysing mass cytometry data similar to that used in our pre-print: [Single-Cell Signalling Analysis of Heterocellular Organoids](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/659896v2). With code in both Python and R, the workflow assumes some preliminary and inter-step processing through the platform [Cytobank](https://cytobank.org/) (although the user could in theory use any other solution for this and the gating steps).

*MISSING*: Explain the workflow, when we move from code to cytobank, and what kind of data we have as I/O.
