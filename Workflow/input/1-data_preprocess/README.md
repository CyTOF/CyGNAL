# Preprocessing Step

Add here your .txt untransformed data from mass cytometry.

All data should be pre-processed first before undertaking any of the steps in the workflow

* See on /Data some examples for compatible datasets
* Only tested with Cytobank exports but there should be no reason it wouldn't work with data from other platforms as long as it is formatted as outlined above
